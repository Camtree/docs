title: Publishing with Camtree: using the ISCED vocabularies
---

The Camtree Digital Library uses the ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) vocabularies to ensure that reports are described consistently and can be retrieved when library users search for relevant content.  ISCED provides a framework for applying uniform and internationally agreed definitions to allow comparisons of education systems across countries. It was adopted by the UNESCO General Conference in November 2011 and has been updated subsequently. It is used by a range international bodies and in international archives, libraries and data sharing initiatives.



Other keywords may also be used to describe reports in the Camtree Digital Library; there is another guide 'Choosing keywords for your report', which has advice on how to select keywords to provide more detail about educational context, pedagogical approaches and methodologies.
